#Data Structures Final Project
This Project is for my Data Structures Final Project. It is a Todo list which is a hybrid of a stack and a que. Depending weather the item is of high priority it will push it to the stack, if it is a low priority it will enque it at the back. Once taskes are compleated you can remove them from the que.
